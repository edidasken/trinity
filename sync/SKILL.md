description: Apply the repo-fix checklist from fixes.md to another codebase. Use when porting known TypeScript, module-contract, runtime safety, link-validation, and reachability fixes such as explicit exports/imports, API signature alignment, safer browser API handling, date sorting corrections, duplicate key removal, stale argument cleanup, tighter payload typing, broken link repair, and missing module wiring. Use in iterative, piece-by-piece passes for repo-wide repair work, with optional automated handoff to the next pass.

# RepoFix

## Scope rules — read before doing anything

**Do NOT scan the entire repo.** Do NOT run open-ended `find` or `grep` across all directories. Every step below is bounded to a specific file or a small, named set of files.

- Work **one fix at a time**. If the user names a fix number (e.g. "fix 3") apply only that fix.
- For repo-wide repair work, treat each pass as a **single-fix task**. Do one fix, verify it, stop, and hand off the next pass instead of batching multiple classes of issues together.
- Read **at most 3 files** before editing: the target file plus its direct callers if a contract change is needed.
- If a typecheck is needed, run it once at the very end, not repeatedly.
- If a fix touches more than 5 files, **stop, list what remains, and ask the user before continuing**.

---

## Instructions

### 1. Identify the single fix to apply
Match the user’s request to one numbered pattern in the catalog below. If the request is ambiguous, ask which pattern to apply rather than guessing or applying several at once.

### 2. Read only the target file and its direct callers
Open the file named by the user (or identified by the pattern). If a contract change is needed, grep for the exported symbol to find direct callers — stop at the first 10 results. Do not traverse transitive callers.

### 3. Apply the smallest contract-preserving change
Use the pattern below and keep runtime behavior intact:

- Export explicit symbols instead of relying on side effects or globals.
- Match exported function signatures to real call sites; remove stale overloads.
- Narrow browser API results (`FileReader.result`) safely before using as string.
- Remove duplicate object keys; keep object shapes aligned with consumers.
- Replace unsafe global `firebase` access with the repo’s imported adapter.
- Normalize date comparisons with `Date` objects or numeric timestamps.
- Remove obsolete `ctx` arguments at call sites only.
- Tighten payload types to the exact shape the code uses.

### 4. Update direct callers only
Update only the callers you already read in step 2. Do not chase transitive callers in this pass. If more callers exist, note them and stop.

### 5. Typecheck once at the end
Only if the user asks for verification, run:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit -p jsconfig.json 2>&1 | head -40
```

Report errors; do not auto-fix them unless the user asks.

### 6. Automate the next pass when the user wants the whole repo repaired
If the user asks for a full repo repair, automate the workflow at the pass level:

- Start with a bounded discovery pass to identify the next likely fix class.
- Apply exactly one fix in the current pass.
- Verify that fix before moving on.
- Summarize the files changed and the issue class fixed.
- Use `new_task` with compact context to hand off the next pass automatically.
- Repeat until the repair queue is empty or the next pass would exceed the 5-file limit.

This is the automation layer: it chains passes together, but each pass still stays narrow and piece-by-piece.

### 7. Keep the repair queue exhaustive
For repo-wide repair jobs, do not stop after the original 8 catalog items if the repo still has repairable breakage. Keep a queue of follow-up passes for the most common remaining classes:

- Broken internal links, route targets, and navigation destinations
- Missing, stale, or unresolved imports and exports
- Renamed module paths that no longer match call sites
- Syntax or parse errors in `.js` modules surfaced during repair
- Missing registration or wiring for new views, modules, or pages
- Reachability gaps where a file exists but is not linked into the app
- Broken asset references, image paths, CSS links, and favicon references
- Stale menu items, sidebar entries, and sitemap/docs links
- Configuration drift in manifests, scripts, path aliases, and env references
- Failing build, test, lint, or typecheck steps surfaced by the repair process
- Dead or duplicate routes, views, pages, and index barrels
- Import/export mismatches caused by renamed files or moved modules
- Malformed HTML, JSX, or template syntax in view files
- Missing or broken registration in routers, dispatchers, schedulers, or app switchers
- Obsolete documentation references that point to removed or renamed features

Run these as bounded passes, one class at a time, and stop only when the current queue is empty or a pass would violate the scope limits above.

### 8. Keep validation lightweight but complete
After each pass, do the smallest verification that proves the fix worked. For repo-wide work, prefer a bounded follow-up check over a full open-ended scan, and only escalate to a broader verification if the user asked for it.

### 9. Keep searching for adjacent breakage while the queue is non-empty
If a fix reveals an adjacent class of breakage, add it to the queue and continue in a fresh pass instead of stopping early. The repair job is only complete when:
- the original requested fix is done,
- the current queue of likely repo-repair classes is exhausted,
- and the next pass would not be expected to surface another reachable issue.

## Known fix catalog

1. **Explicit vessel exports** — Export implementation directly; update consumers to use real imports instead of globals.
2. **Accurate message APIs** — Align exported function signatures to runtime use; remove stale placeholders.
3. **Safe file reader handling** — Narrow `FileReader.result`; handle `string`, `ArrayBuffer`, and `null`.
4. **Duplicate invitation fields** — Remove duplicate `email` keys; keep row objects canonical.
5. **No unsafe global firebase** — Replace `firebase.*` globals with the repo’s import path or adapter.
6. **Deterministic date sorting** — Convert to timestamps or `Date` before compare/sort; guard missing dates.
7. **Remove stale mount args** — Drop obsolete `ctx` from mount calls; update callee signature only if context is still needed.
8. **Tighter payload typing** — Replace broad payload types with the exact shape or a discriminated union.

# TODO LIST RECOMMENDED
When starting a new task, it is recommended to create a todo list.

1. Include the task_progress parameter in your next tool call
2. Create a comprehensive checklist of all steps needed
3. Use markdown format: - [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for complete

Benefits of creating a todo list now:

- Clear roadmap for implementation
- Progress tracking throughout the task
- Nothing gets forgotten or missed
- Users can see, monitor, and edit the plan

Example structure:

```md
- [ ] Analyze requirements
- [ ] Set up necessary files
- [ ] Implement main functionality
- [ ] Handle edge cases
- [ ] Test the implementation
- [ ] Verify results
```

Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.
